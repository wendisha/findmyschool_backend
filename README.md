Find My School - BACKEND

Description
Find My School is a web application that allows a user to create an account by clicking the Sign Up option. Once a user is registered, they can browse schools by clicking this option from the Navbar. Schools are searchable by zipcode, and they can be bookmarked by the user, to be saved in their profile. Also, each school will have the option to be linked to an external site, where more information can be found about it.
